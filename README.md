Portfolio for Data Science, including the powerpoint slides, word documents and Jupyter Notebook assignments 3 up to and including 19 in .ipynb and .html format.

The Jupyter Notebook files are examples of data analysis and the Powerpoint slides / word document gives you an idea of what Data Sciene consists of.
